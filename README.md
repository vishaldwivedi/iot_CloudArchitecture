# iot_CloudArchitecture
This repository creates a full fledged cloud architecture [Will be using Microsoft Azure here] for IOT solution using different architecture patterns and cloud services


### In this Architecture we are not going to use Azure IOT Central as that does not suffice to the customization we need in our use case

# Problem Statements:

This solution will be used to 
1) monitor the devices remotely by capturing the data from the devices. 
2) Management of devices to add/remove and update devices and configuration.
2) Enable communication from backend to device so that the devices can be controlled remotely
3) Triggers and alarms can be set so that devices which are malfuncting or going to malfunction can be identified.
4) A user interface will be provided to display all the devices information on a map. 
5) All the relevant KPI related to the device data will be available on the user interface which can identify the devices which are not performing good.

# Solution Components
1) IOT Hub
2) Simulation Device solution
3) Interface [First Draft]
4) Application Gateway
5) Microservices on Dockers and Kubernetes
5) API Gateway
6) Stream Analytics
7) Hot Storage for stream
8) Cold Storage for Data Analytics
9) Diagnostics

# Solution Architecture
